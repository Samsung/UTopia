# üèÜ Bugs & CVEs 

The showcase of bugs and CVEs found by *UTopia*-based fuzzers serves a variety of purpose:
- Show the effect of the fuzzing automation approach (i.e.,*UTopia* can help find more bugs in the projects that are already registered and have been being fuzz tested in OSS-Fuzz)
- Provide insight into making unit tests that can work well with *UTopia* (i.e., Fuzzing friendly unit tests)
- Increase the visibility of various fuzz drivers so that people can learn or improve fuzz driver composing strategies

Note that The merged fuzz drivers are different from the original ones generated by *UTofia* because they are reviewed and modified by the community.
